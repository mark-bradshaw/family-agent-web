            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 10, 2026</p>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how the Bradshaw Family Agent ("we," "our," or "the Agent") handles 
                information when integrating with Google Workspace services. The Bradshaw Family Agent is a 
                custom-built AI assistant designed exclusively for personal use by the Bradshaw family.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Scope and Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The Bradshaw Family Agent is a private, family-only application that runs on a local home server. 
                It is not a public service and is not available to anyone outside the Bradshaw family.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Google API Services</h2>
            <p>
                The Agent integrates with Google Workspace services to provide household management features. 
                This integration requires authentication with Google's OAuth 2.0 system.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Data Access and Usage</h2>
            <p>
                When authorized, the Agent may access:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Calendar data for scheduling and event management</li>
                <li>Gmail for email notifications and management</li>
                <li>Google Drive for document access and organization</li>
                <li>Other Google Workspace services as needed for family household operations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All data accessed by the Agent is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Used solely for the purpose of providing household management assistance to the Bradshaw family</li>
                <li>Processed locally on the family's home server</li>
                <li>Never shared with third parties</li>
                <li>Never sold or used for advertising</li>
                <li>Never stored outside of the local home server environment</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>
                The Agent operates on a local home server within the Bradshaw family's private network. All data 
                processing occurs locally, and no user data is transmitted to external servers or cloud services 
                except as required to interact with authorized Google Workspace services.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                The Agent may temporarily cache data from Google services to provide responsive assistance. 
                This cached data is stored only on the local home server and is automatically managed according 
                to the application's operational needs.
            </p>
            
            <h2>User Control and Access</h2>
            <p>
                Family members can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Revoke the Agent's access to their Google account at any time through their Google Account settings</li>
                <li>Request deletion of any cached data by contacting the administrator</li>
                <li>View what permissions the Agent has been granted through Google's security settings</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                The Agent uses the following third-party services:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Workspace:</strong> For calendar, email, and document management features</li>
                <li><strong>Discord:</strong> As the interface for family interaction with the Agent</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of these services has its own privacy policy that governs how they handle data.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the Agent's functionality 
                or legal requirements. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will be revised accordingly.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Compliance</h2>
            <p>
                The Bradshaw Family Agent complies with Google's API Services User Data Policy, including the 
                Limited Use requirements. This means that the Agent's use of information received from Google APIs 
                adheres to the following principles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use of Google user data is limited to providing or improving user-facing features</li>
                <li>No transfer of Google user data to third parties</li>
                <li>No use of Google user data for advertising</li>
                <li>No use of Google user data for purposes unrelated to the item's core functionality</li>
            </ul>
